            <p>On my quest to complete the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) exam, I've decided to supplement my normal notes with a few web pages. I'll use them to represent various aspects I'll be studying, as well as to try out new CSS or JS ideas I have. It may even give me motivation to study.</p>
            <p>I'm not expecting to update this super frequently but the list below will link to any pages I've compeleted (or nearly completed). Hopefully you can learn something along the way too!</p>
